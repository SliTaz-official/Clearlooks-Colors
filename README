Clearlooks-Colors 1.0+ is only for GNOME 2.24/Ubuntu Intrepid

You need Emerald Theme Manager to be able to use the included emerald themes.

There are optional metacity themes (meant to look a bit more like the emerald themes) They're called X-Colors Lite and X-Colors Dark. You can choose them in the appearance preferences. X-Colors Dark should only be used with dark themes, and viceversa.

You can change the color scheme of a theme in GNOME's appearance preferences, by selecting customize and then the "Colors" tab. I recommend changing only the "Selected background" square for a custom colorscheme, but feel free to go wild and make the theme your own. Use the included tango color palette for some good color choices.

You can also customize any theme further by editing its /gtk-2.0/gtkrc file. There are line-by line instructions inside the file to help you achieve any look or maybe even teach you a thing or two about GTK themes.

You can edit the included panel.rc file to customize panel backgrounds to your liking.

The transparent wallpaper will adjust to any background color, but darker colors will look better than lighter ones.

This theme is heavily influenced clearlooks/ubuntu artwork, so really most of the credit should go to those projects.

You should use the GNOME-Colors icons with this theme.

You will always have permission to modify, release and distribute this theme as you see fit.. so share it with grandma, include it in your distro, make it better!
